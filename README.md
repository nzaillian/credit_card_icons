# Credit Card icons


**Note: this project fixes the [credit\_card\_icons gem](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/credit_card_icons) for the Rails 4/5+ asset pipeline.**

This gem is a Rails engine and includes a host of asset files including standalone image sets (icons), CSS sprites and stylesheets for the CSS sprites.

## Usage

In `Gemfile`.

`gem 'credit_card_icons', git: 'https://github.com/nzaillian/credit_card_icons.git'`

Install via bundler:

`bundle`

Include the stylesheet(s) of choice in your Rails stylesheets application manifest file, fx `application.css` or similar:

```css
/*
 *= require credit_cards_default
*/
```

Using *Compass*, include stylesheet(s) via `@import 'credit_cards_default';` instead.

Use the cards via CSS classes like this:

## Stylesheets available

* credit_cards_default (24x24)
* credit_cards_24 (24x24)
* credit_cards_32 (32x32)

* straight_cards_32 (51x32)
* straight_cards_64 (102x64)
* straight_cards_128 (204x128)

* curved_cards_32 (51x32)
* curved_cards_64 (102x64)
* curved_cards_128 (204x128)

%ul.cc
	%li.card.mastercard

Feel free to improve this gem by modifying the css rules and/or include view helpers etc.

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
